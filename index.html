                        I have played the Xbox 360 for the past few weeks now, and that is my inspiration to make this website.
                        I am not a pro gamer, but I accausly play video games. And I think that is enough for me to talk about 
                        the Xbox 360.

                <h4>My History with the Console</h4>
                    <p>

                        I remember when I was a kid, I wanted to get a Xbox 360, but never got one. During the 
                        Christmas of 2013, my oldest brother bought a white Xbox 360 Slim and I was super 
                        excited. He didn't actually tell me that we are going to get a Xbox 360, but I found out about it. During that time,
                        I remember seeing Xbox 360 games mailed to our mailbox. I was confused at first, but then I start to come up 
                        with an idea that my oldest brother bought a Xbox 360. When my family got the Xbox 360, the first game I got was
                        Skylander Spyro's Adventure. Even though that my family have a Xbox 360, I didn't actually used the console alot. Even after how 
                        much I want a Xbox, I didn't play it offen. Part of it is because my oldest brother was going to college so he brought the Xbox with
                        him.

                <h4>Recently with My Xbox</h4>
                    <p>
            
                        Right now, I am trying to play my Xbox as much as possbile because I want to make up for all the time I didn't play it.
                        I have a decent game collection that I can't wait to play all the games that I have. It might take awhile though. In term
                        of the console itself, I think it's healthy. It's not making too much noise and the console is not slow. I found out I 
                        can clear the cache on the console, so hopefully, it can speed up the console.
