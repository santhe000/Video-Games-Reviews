                        I have played the Xbox 360 for the past few weeks now, and that is my inspiration to make this website.
                        I am not a pro gamer, but I accausly play video games. And I think that is enough for me to talk about 
                        the Xbox 360.

                <h4>My History with the Console</h4>
                    <p>

                        I remember when I was a kid, I wanted to get a Xbox 360, but never got one. During the 
                        Christmas of 2013, my oldest brother bought a white Xbox 360 Slim and I was super 
                        excited. He didn't actually tell me that we are going to get a Xbox 360, but I found out about it. During that time,
                        I remember seeing Xbox 360 games mailed to our mailbox. I was confused at first, but then I start to come up 
                        with an idea that my oldest brother bought a Xbox 360. When my family got the Xbox 360, the first game I got was
                        Skylander Spyro's Adventure. Even though that my family have a Xbox 360, I didn't actually played. Even after how 
                        much I want a Xbox, I didn't play that much on it.
