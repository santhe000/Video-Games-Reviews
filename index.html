                        I have played the Xbox 360 for the past few weeks now, and that is my inspiration to make this website.
                        I am not a pro gamer, but I occasionally play video games. And I think that is enough for me to talk about 
                        the Xbox 360.

                <h4>My History with the Xbox 360</h4>
                    <p>

                        I remember when I was a kid, I wanted to get a Xbox 360, but never got one. During the 
                        Christmas of 2013, my oldest brother bought a white Xbox 360 Slim and I was super 
                        excited. He didn't actually tell me that we are going to get a Xbox 360, but I found out about it. During that time,
                        I remember seeing Xbox 360 games mailed to our mailbox. I was confused at first, but then I start to come up 
                        with an idea that my oldest brother bought a Xbox 360. When my family got the Xbox 360, the first game I got was
                        Skylander Spyro's Adventure. Even though that my family have a Xbox 360, I didn't actually used the console alot. Even after how 
                        much I want a Xbox, I didn't play it offen. Part of it is because my oldest brother was going to college so he brought the Xbox with
                        him.

                <h4>Recently with My Xbox</h4>
                    <p>
            
                        Right now, I am trying to play my Xbox as much as possbile because I want to make up for all the time I didn't play it.
                        I have a decent game collection that I can't wait to play all the games that I have. It might take awhile though. In term
                        of the console itself, I think it's healthy. It's not making too much noise and the console is not slow. I found out I 
                        can clear the cache on the console, so hopefully, it can speed up the console. The Xbox is collecting some dust and I 
                        should clean it.

                <h4>My History with the Playstation 2</h4>
                    <p>

                        When I was a kid, I loved the Playstation 2. I remember one time I woke up with my brother before the sunrise and we 
                        played WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2008. My parents were going somewhere and me and my brother played the PS2 in 
                        our tent, and the PS2 was connected to a T.V outside the tent. We weren't camping, where I was born, there was tons 
                        of mosquitos so you have to sleep in tents that will keep the mosquitos from sucking your blood. I am not sure what me 
                        and my brother were doing in WWE, but I think we were making our own wrestlers. Making our own wrestlers were the best
                        part of the game.
                        
                    </p>
                
                   <img src = "WWE01.jpg" width = "40%">
                    <p style = "width:40%"><code>I got this image from GameSpot.</code></p>
                    
                    <p>
                        
                        Another memory I had was trouble with the memory card. When you play games with the PS2, you had to save your game progress
                        with the memory card. My brother and I treasured the memory card because it was so important to play games with on the PS2.
                        I wonder if you can keep the memory card inserted into the system without taking it out. If you can keep the memory card in
                        the console, I wish I knew that because I lost the memory card so many times. I think my oldest brother had to buy three or
                        four memory card. I think it's funny how we buy memory card because we lost it not that we need more space for our game saves.
                        Without a memory card, me and my brother still played games on the PS2 anyway. When my brother and I played this game called
                        Ben 10 Protector of Earth we had to restart the story mulipte times. We don't get the save the game so many times that I forgot
                        there was a save feature. The only time we finished the game was when we had a memory card.

                     <p>
                        I have a <b>Nintendo DSi XL</b>. I don't play it anymore though because my only game card doesn't work. I used the DS to play one game.
                        The game was Pokemon Black. 
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        Looking back now, my DS was my source of video games because I didn't play my Xbox when Pokemon Black still 
                        work. My oldest brother gave me the DSi. I think he gave it to me because he was going to college and he didn't want to bring too
                        much stuff. This was also my first DS. When I was a kid, I wanted a DS, and when I was around thirteen, I got one. One time, my parents brought
                        me and my brother to their friend's house. My parents' friend had a daughter who was about my age. She had a DS
                        and I thought it was super cool. Back then, I didn't know what a DS was. As I grew older, I went to school, at the school there was
                        a friend of my and we were having a conversation and he asked me if I wanted a DS because he is going to America or somehwere that is not Cambodia and 
                        he can get me one. I told him to get me one because I always wanted one. So he told me that he will try to get me a DS and I went to class 
                        feeling excited. I even told my brother about this. So he went to away on a vaction and I just waited for him to get back so I can get
                        my DS. Before I got the DS, me and my family moved to the United States before my friend came back from vacation. I am not sure he actually bought me a DS because I moved to the US
                        but also, it was too good to be ture that someone would buy me a video game console. I also told him to get me a few games for the DS so I can 
                        play it. I remember one of the coolest game that was on the DS at the time was a Ben 10 game.
